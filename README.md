## Purpose
To modify and improve layout and design of given code to create a custom portfolio website suited to accessability, and meets the standards for a responsive layout.

## Process

Firstly, I changed the overall color scheme of the website in css to fit the new hero background image I inserted.
Next I added all links to any application mentioned on the website (i.e website links, image links etc). These include the links to the about me section, the work section and everything inside of it (i.e Run Buddy), and the contact me section with all personal links.
I added slow scrolling to each link as well.
Next I added alt tags to every image in the code. 
I added style changes to the header borders giving them rounded styles.
I then added an inserted image of myself, and modified it in css to suit the style of the website.
Lasty, I added any remaining accessability changes and any missing quality comments needed.
